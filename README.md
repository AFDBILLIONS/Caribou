Caribou is a [Grasshopper plugin](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/) for parsing downloaded Open Street Map data into Rhino geometry.

Caribou is currently in an alpha state. Feedback, issues, and pull-requests are encouraged.

## Features

- âœ… Very fast parsing of even very large files
- âœ… Parsing is performed asynchronously so Grasshopper does not freeze
- âœ… Components embrace a modular approach to filtering and extracting data
- âœ… Parse multiple OSM files simultaneously with de-duplication
- âœ… Allows for querying for arbitrary data, not just defined features/sub-features
- âœ… Outputs are tree-formatted and organised per data-type to allow for downstream filtering and baking

## Roadmap

- ðŸ•˜ Faster!
- ðŸ•˜ Intuitive GUI for defining feature/subfeature filters
- ðŸ•˜ Dedicated component for defining 3D buildings
- ðŸ•˜ Parsing of `<relation>` type data
- ðŸ•˜ Integration with Rhino's `EarthAnchorPoint`

## Setup and Use

- Plugin installation
  1. For now, releases are available in the [Rhino package manager](https://www.rhino3d.com/features/package-manager/) only.
- Data gathering
  1. Go to [https://www.openstreetmap.org](openstreetmap.org)
  2. Locate the general area you wish to model and hit `export`, then `manually select an area`
  3. Click the `OVERPASS API` link to download the `xml` file
- Grasshopper Setup
  1. Place an `Extract Nodes` or `Extract Ways` component (or both)
  2. Use a standard `Read File` component for your `xml` file and connect it as `OSM Content`
  3. Using a panel, list the data you wish to extract in a comma-separated `key` or `key=value` format. These can include official [features and sub-features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features) types or any form of meta-data.  E.g.:
  ```
    building,
    highway=traffic_signals,
    cuisine=mexican,
    addr:street=Swanston Street
  ```
