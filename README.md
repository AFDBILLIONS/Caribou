Caribou is a [Grasshopper plugin](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/) for parsing downloaded Open Street Map data into Rhino geometry.

Caribou is currently in an beta state. Feedback, issues, and pull-requests are encouraged.

## Features

- âœ… Windows and MacOS are both fully supported
- âœ… Very fast parsing of even very large files
- âœ… Data-rich GUI interface provided for understanding and filtering OSM metadata
- âœ… Parsing is performed asynchronously so Grasshopper remains responsive
- âœ… Parse multiple OSM files simultaneously with de-duplication of geometry
- âœ… Allows for querying for arbitrary data outside of the primary OSM features/sub-features taxonomy
- âœ… Outputs are tree-formatted and organised per data-type to allow for downstream filtering, tagging, baking, etc

## Roadmap

- ðŸ•˜ Documentation and examples
- ðŸ•˜ Further speed optimisations
- ðŸ•˜ Component to help construct queries for arbitrary Metadata
- ðŸ•˜ Parsing of `<relation>` type data
- ðŸ•˜ Integration with Rhino's `EarthAnchorPoint`

## Setup and Use

![Image of the definition setup](/assets/demo-v0.7.png)

- Plugin installation
  1. For now, releases are available by searching for *Caribou* in the [Rhino package manager](https://www.rhino3d.com/features/package-manager/) only.
- Data gathering
  1. Go to [https://www.openstreetmap.org](openstreetmap.org)
  2. Locate the general area you wish to model and hit `export`, then `manually select an area`
  3. Click the `OVERPASS API` link to download the `xml` file
- Grasshopper setup
  1. Place Caribou's `Extract Nodes` or `Extract Ways` component (or both)
  2. Place a standard Grasshopper `File Path` component, reference your `xml` file(s), and connect the outputs to the `OSM File` input parameter
  3. Place Caribou's `Specify Features` component.
  4. Click the button at the bottom of the `Specify Features` component and select the types of features you want to extract.
  5. Connect the `OSM Features` output to the `OSM Features` input.

See `examples/Simple.ghx` for a definition the contains a completed example of the above steps as well as components to provide a Legend and categorised baking.
